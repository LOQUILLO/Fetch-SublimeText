Fetch-SublimeText2
==================

This is a compilation of some "Fetch" that are here and I have updated and added other repositories.
This I created for those using Nettuts + Fetch and can update Fetch.sublime-settings.
I hope you all have suggestions.

Added Style-Guide-Boilerplate: a starting point for crafting web style guides.

Added Effeckt.css: UI-Less & Performant Transitions & Animations.

Added HTML5 Bones: The template that goes back to basics.

Fixed small errors.

Updated jQuery to the last version.
