Fetch-SublimeText2
==================

For those who are using Nettuts + Fetch (https://github.com/weslly/Nettuts-Fetch) I created this Fetch.sublime-settings (which is a compilation of some that exist here, but they are obsolete or outdated repositories) to make you easier likely needs you have to develop your projects.

Every so often I'll be updating, adding new repositories that should be very useful in your developments.

I hope you help me confirm if the files are not active in their respective repositories so I can update them.

I also accept suggestions to add some other repositories.

Paste the file Fetch.sublime-settings into \ Packages \ User \

Updated with new and more usefull repos.

Added color codes for HTML and CSS, Symfony, PHP phar files (Composer, Pear, Phing, CS-Fixer, Mess Detector, Unit) checkit out.

Fixed an error with Nettuts, this wasn't supporting characters such as "Ã«".

Added GoogleMaps API, Google Web Starter Kit, Cordova, Parallax, icons (icons social and others), Image resizer, Slider Revolution, slides.
Updated links.
